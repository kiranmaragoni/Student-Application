### Student-Application

Going to build an application that is used to access student information. Users can use
this website to do the following things.
1. To see the list of all students in the university
2. To view details of individual students
3. To add new students to the university
4. To edit existing student details
5. To delete existing students
Screens to design/develop to achieve the above functionality.
1. Students List
2. View Profile
3. Add Student
4. Edit Student 

This app or interface extend fair contains the University name and student list. The client has got to access the student information to edit , update, deltete, to view.

## Challenges Faced and How Was it Overcome

 1. I have faced some challenge in implementing of main file(student list). But by reffering multiple platform I solved the issue.
 2.I have issues in java script implementation and performing actions, but putting continous effort I resolved .
 3. Put muliple attempt for improvment for interface styles.
