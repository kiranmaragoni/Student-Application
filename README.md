## Challenges Faced and How Was it Overcome

 1. I have faced some challenge in implementing of main file(student list). But by reffering multiple platform I solved the issue.
 2. I have issues in java script implementation and performing actions, but putting continous effort I resolved .
 3. Put muliple attempt for improvment for interface styles. Used mostly html,css and java script depending upon requirement.
