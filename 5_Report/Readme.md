# Student Application

## Introduction

Going to build an application that is used to access student information. Users can use this website to do the following things.
1. To see the list of all students in the university
2. To view details of individual students
3. To add new students to the university
4. To edit existing student details
5. To delete existing students
Screens to design/develop to achieve the above functionality.
1. Students List
2. View Profile
3. Add Student
4. Edit Student

.

## Research


●  Using Javascript, HTML and CSS to build the website. (You can also make use of any
Javascript frameworks like Angular, ReactJS etc…).
● You can use HTML5 localStorage or implement your own backend( if you have
expertise) to store the student data.
● You can take the wireframe pdf as a design reference. You can add styles (colors,
animations) of your choice to make the app look appealing.
● Implement the Student’s list view with HTML.
● All fields in the Add/Edit student forms are mandatory.
● Add form validations to check if all the fields are filled by the user before submitting the
form.
● Add validations to the fields to accept relevant data.
○ “Roll No” field should accept only numbers.
○ “Email” field should accept valid email.
