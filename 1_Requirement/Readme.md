# Student Application

## Introduction

Going to build an application that is used to access student information. Users can use this website to do the following things.
1. To see the list of all students in the university
2. To view details of individual students
3. To add new students to the university
4. To edit existing student details
5. To delete existing students
Screens to design/develop to achieve the above functionality.
1. Students List
2. View Profile
3. Add Student
4. Edit Student

This app or interface extend fair contains the client segment. The client has got to press the begin button, then choose the field to play in the jumbled words will be shown on the screen and you have got to sort their correct frame. You'll be able to alter the words on the off chance that you're not able to figure the proper shape. Moreover, you'll be able to check the answer at, to begin with, in the event that you have the points.

## Research

Write a function jumble_decode that takes a jumbled word as an input parameter.
It will generate all the anagrams for that jumbled word using the anagrams function (see below).


Use a "dictionary file" (a text file listing all known English words) to filter out the the anagrams that are valid English words.


This function must return a list of of valid English words. Please do not print the results.


Write a function anagrams that will generate all the anagrams for a given word (in our case, we'll be providing it jumbled words. This function:
must use recursion to solve for the anagrams!

must return a Python list of all generated anagrams (regardless of whether they are valid English words).

## Defining Our System
In this project, when we excute the code then the game starts with a pop up. On that pop up click on start. when the game starts, client have to select the categories like Animals, Body parts, Colour, Fruits, Shapes, Vegetables, Vehicles etc. click on the category that client wants to play. client get jumbled word of selected category and they have to answer the jumbled word in text box. If client identify the correct answer, we write it in text box and click on submit, then client get a pop up window "correct answer keep it up" and they also get score. If our answer is wrong, in pop up window they get "incorrect answer try your best" and as our answer is wrong then no score will be given. If client does not understand the jumbled word there will be option of changing the word. if client wants to know the answer they have an option answer when they click on it answer will be displayed by decreasing the score.This jumbled word quiz helps to improve IQ level.
